# RecMate – Professional Stream Recorder

RecMate is a Windows tool for automating the management, monitoring, and recording of cam streams. The application combines Playwright-powered extractors, an integrated LibVLC-based player, and streamlined workflows for monitoring, recording, and reviewing your archive.

## Highlights
- **Multi-platform support:** Native integrations for Chaturbate, Cam4, BongaCams, Stripchat, Stripchat VR, Dreamcam, and Dreamcam VR.
- **Reliable status detection:** Platform-specific checks ensure live/offline states are recognized correctly before recordings start.
- **Automated recording:** License-aware recording limits, custom quality presets, and automatic file naming keep your workflow organized.
- **Monitor & review:** Embedded stream player, progress indicators, filtering, and tagging for archived sessions.
- **Bundled tooling:** LibVLC, yt-dlp, ffmpeg/ffprobe, and Playwright browsers ship with the app for a zero-setup experience.

## Version 1.08 (2025-11-12)
- **Stripchat VR pre-check:** A Playwright-based live verification now runs before each recording. Offline/private sessions are blocked before yt-dlp launches.
- **More robust captures:** HTTP fallbacks trigger only when the VR session is confirmed live, eliminating false starts.
- **New distribution:** Release package `RecMate_v1.08.zip` available in `C:\Users\User\CascadeProjects\RecMate_Distributions\`.
